\chapter{Future work}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Better handling of sub-functions.  Some of the automatic abstraction
  stuff would be relevant here.
\item
  Combine with invariant inference stuff to get rid of the constraint
  that you must crash quickly.
\item
  The HB graph-based fix generator.
\item
  Extend to cyclic {\StateMachines}.  Main places where we assume that
  you need to be acyclic are the symbolic execution engine (which
  needs single dynamic assignment form) and $\Phi$ elimination (which
  needs a complete CDG).
\end{itemize}
