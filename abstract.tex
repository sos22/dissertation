Blah.

\todo{I really need to come up with a better name for this; SLI really
  doesn't have anything to do with anything any more.}

Major todo items:

\begin{itemize}
\item The alias analysis needs a good editing.
\item The unification simplification needs a good editing.
\item So does the frame pointer elimination section.
\item Canonicalisation needs an almost complete rewrite.
\item The section on placing VCs needs rewriting.
\item The section on mandatory concurrency needs rewriting.  Or I could
   just drop it.
\item The entire eval section needs a lot more work.
\item Related work is a bit of a mess.
\item Conclusions are missing.
\item Need to do something cunning about enforcing contradictory HB graphs.
\item Need to come up with a better story on timeouts in the enforcers.
\item Kill off the compiled enforcer bits completely.
\item Kill off DRS mode completely.
\item The section on generating fixes needs a good editing.
\end{itemize}
