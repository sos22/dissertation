\smh{Ok; this chapter suffers somewhat from the lack of clear + useful
  definitions/abstractions in the earlier chapters.  Remember: you are
  trying to explain the system you built at multiple levels of
  abstraction; it's the 1-sentence version versus the 100 page version
  versus the 2 page version, ....  General recipe is: (i) explanation
  (1 para, signposting rest of text), (ii) walkthrough (2-3 pages,
  with diagrams, entire process in moderate detail) ... identify terms
  and concepts: crucial to be able to ignore+elide some details. (iii)
  deep dive (for parts identified above) (iv) recap (like (i) or
  (ii)).}
