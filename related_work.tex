\item

\end{itemize}

Generic binary analysis stuff:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Balakrishnan, G., Reps, T., Kidd, N., Lal, A., Lim, J., Melski, D., Gruian, R., Yong, S., Chen, C.-H., and Teitelbaum, T., Model checking x86 executables with CodeSurfer/x86 and WPDS++, (tool-demonstration paper). In Proc. Computer-Aided Verification, 2005.
\item
  Balakrishnan, G., Reps, T., Melski, D., and Teitelbaum, T., WYSINWYX: What You See Is Not What You eXecute. In Proc. IFIP Working Conference on Verified Software: Theories, Tools, Experiments, Zurich, Switzerland, Oct. 10-13, 2005.
\item
  BAP: A binary analysis platform, Jager et al, 2011.
\item
  Something about separation logic?
  Should certainly explain somewhere why it doesn't work so well when doing concurrency things.
\end{itemize}

SSA bits:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  HSSA -- Chow et al, Effective representation of aliases and indirect memory operations in SSA form, 1996.
\end{itemize}

Concurrency analysis:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Synchronisation removal: Choi et al, Escape analysis for Java, 1999; Ruf 2000.
\item
  Procedural concurrency graph: Joisher, Schieder, et al, On a technique for transparently empowering classical compiler optimizations on multithreaded code, 2012.
\item
  Something on parallel execution graphs and may-happen-in-parallel e.g. Li and Verbrugge 2004, A practical MHP information analysis for concurrent Java programs
\item
  Thread escape analysis: Choi et al, Escape analysis for Java, 1999.
\item
  Have a look at Chugh et al, 2008, RADAR.  Dataflow analysis for concurrent programs using datarace detection.
\end{itemize}

VC generation:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Dijkstra's weakest precondition thing.
\item
  Jager and Brumley, Efficient directionless weakest preconditions, 2010.
\end{itemize}

VC checking:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Find some simple SMT solvers and see if they actually win anything over just using the SLI sat checker.
  e.g. CVC3, Yices.
\end{itemize}

Enforcement:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Quite a lot of other papers on using runtime monitors for non-concurrency properties.
  Chain refs from ``Partially evaluating finite-state runtime monitors ahead of time'', Bodden, Lam, and Hendren, 2012.
\item
  DataCollider, obviously.
\end{itemize}

Other things to compare to:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  SOAP: Long, Ganesh, et al, Automatic Input Rectification, ~2011.
\item
  KLEE!
\end{itemize}
